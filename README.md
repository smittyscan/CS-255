DriverPass System Analysis and Design – CS 255 Portfolio Reflection
What was the DriverPass project about?
DriverPass was a system design project for a company that offers driving education and test preparation services. The client needed a comprehensive platform that would allow customers to register for driving lessons and tests, view progress, interact with instructors, and handle payments. Additionally, the system needed to support administrative tasks such as managing users, drivers, schedules, and integrating with external systems like the DMV.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I did a solid job translating user needs from the interview transcript into meaningful system features. I organized my diagrams and documentation clearly, and I communicated system functions in a way that would make sense even to nontechnical audiences. I also think my use case diagram was especially strong in showing the relationships between users and the key features of the system.

What would you revise if given the chance?
If I were to revise one part, I would improve the early activity diagrams. My first attempts were a bit too simplistic and missed some user decision flows. I later refined them with better decision logic and more complete steps. In the future, I would start with more detailed flowcharts before jumping into UML tools.

How did you interpret and implement user needs?
I carefully analyzed the interview transcript and highlighted key tasks users expected the system to perform. I mapped each of these needs to a specific feature or diagram element in my design. It’s essential to keep user needs at the center of any system to ensure the end product is actually usable and solves real problems.

How do you approach designing software?
I typically start by understanding user goals and breaking them into manageable components. I use a combination of user stories, diagrams, and role analysis to clarify the structure and flow of a system. Going forward, I plan to incorporate more prototyping and feedback loops to better validate design decisions early in the process.
